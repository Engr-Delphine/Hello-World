# Hello-World
My first Hello World repository. This is the Hello World project repository where project folders, files, images, spreads sheets and data sets are stored. In this repository, you will also find the resources that are needed for this project to succeed.
This repository is created with a default main barach. A feature branch is added when a new feature needs to be added to the project without making any changes to the main source of the code.
Saved changes are called commits. All commits must be done with a commit message. A commit message is a summary of what changes were made and why they were made so that other project collaborastors will understand what you've done and why.

Thanks
